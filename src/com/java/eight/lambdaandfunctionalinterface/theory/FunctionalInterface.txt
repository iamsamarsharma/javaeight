FunctionalInterface:
If interface contain only one abstract method then it is functional interface.

Some functional interface already present in jave before java8 are
    runnable --> run()
    callable -->  call()
    ActionListener --> actionPerformed()
    comparable --> compareTo()

A functional interface we can have any no.

eg. : interface one {
            public void m1();
            default void m2(){
                ...
                ...
            }
            public static void m3() {
                .
                ........
                .............
            }
        }


@FunctionalInterface annotation:
To indicate that interface is functional interface java introduce @FunctionalInterface. This annotation is optional
Advantage of using this annotation if someone accidentally add new abstract method in previously created functional interface
compiler will give an error.

If a interface is marked as @Functional interface it can't be empty it must contain one abstract method.
CE: No abstract method found in interface <interface name>
